# Linear-Equation-Calculator-with-EM-method

## this program is designed for calculate linear equation with elementary matrix

When you start the program, it will ask for the number of rows, columns, and the elements of the augmented matrix. You need to input the number of rows and columns, then enter the elements of the augmented matrix in row-major order (from left to right across each row). After typing each input, press 'Enter' to proceed to the next one. Once all inputs are provided, the program will display the value of each variable.
